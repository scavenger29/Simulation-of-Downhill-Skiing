This texture is provided with a grayscale bumpmap/reflect map image for each size. I used this bumpmap in 3D Studio Max for the crate example rendered as a reflect map in my raytrace material. I did not actually use it as a bumpmap in the example.

I provided the files in 600x600, and 300x300 sizes. I did this so that the indivuals downloading this texture could have a high resolution version for editing or special uses, and the individuals just wishing for a medium or small sized image can immeditately put a smaller size to work. The images are provided in .bmp format so that there is no image quality loss for those wanting to edit or having special uses for the texture that require extreme clarity. You can of course convert to a lesser quality and smaller fize format if desired. 

Anyone downloading this texture is free to distribute it, use it, or modify it in any way desired, but it may not be sold in or as a commercial product without my written permission. If you use it or modify it into anything interesting or in a public medium, I'd love to hear about it. You can contact me at at the below email address. Please do not contact me for anything other than examples of use or regarding employment/contractual work.
